   <h2>Welcome</h2>
   <p>Hey, I am Lidya. I'm a curious and motivated student currently learning web development. My goal is to build strong foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and eventually move into full-stack development. This portfolio is a reflection of my learning journey, where I showcase the projects Iâ€™ve created as I practice and grow. I enjoy experimenting with code, solving problems, and turning ideas into simple, functional websites. I'm excited to keep learning and look forward to building more advanced and creative web applications over time. To see my woorks you can visit my github account.</p>
